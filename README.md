# Named-Colour
Getting a nearest colour name from RGB values.

This little script takes a RGB hex value and derives a colour name from a dictionary.  The [Resene Dictionary](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Color/resenecolours.txt) is used as a resource for this simple tool.
Other dictionaries may be added.

It uses an approximation of Colour Diference as in this [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_difference);
